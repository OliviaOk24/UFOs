# UFOs

Project Overview 


This project is aimed at helping Dana build a webpage that has an inn-depth analaysis of the UFO Sightings by allowing the users filter for multiple criteria relating to the UFO Sightings at the once. This challenges also allows for the adjustment/updating of the webpage layout/style.


Results
The website works by allowing the user filter the different UFO Sightings data by allowing the user enter multiple options of either the city, state, country, shape or date of the Sighting they wish to search for and then click on the "Filter Table" button which refreshes the page and updates the table with only sightings that match the filters requested. Photos showing the steps as to how these filters are being utilized are shown below. The filter left tab has been updated to accomate for more filtering for the user as shown in the image below.

Summary 

One drawback of this new design is that users might not know what cities or states to search for specific sightings. A dropdown menu with availble options will be useful  (this reecommendation added below). 

2 recommendations will be: 

-Add a feature to allow to change the ascednding/descenfing order of the different columns in the table 
-Add a feature that allows for dropdown menu of the different filters so that users know what options they have to filter based on.
